# Unpoly demo app, ported to Laravel

This is a demo of [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com), a JavaScript library for progressive enhancement of web applications. This demo is a clone of the original Unpoly demo (see [https://demo.unpoly.com/](https://demo.unpoly.com/)), written in Laravel (PHP) instead of Ruby. It is not publically deployed anywhere, but you can clone it, install it and investigate it.

## Known Issues
